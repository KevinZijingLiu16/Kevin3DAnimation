# Code Architecture Explanation: Clean C# and SOLID Principles

## Overview
This document explains the current architecture of the `MovementController` system, why it follows Clean C# practices and SOLID principles, and how it can be easily changed, replaced, tested, and extended.

The system controls a 3D player character in Unity using modular, single-responsibility classes, each defined by an interface for better abstraction and flexibility.

## Current Architecture

```
MovementController.cs        // Main coordinator MonoBehaviour
├── IInputHandler.cs         // Interface for input handling
│   └── InputHandler.cs      // New Input System logic
├── IGravityHandler.cs       // Interface for gravity logic
│   └── GravityHandler.cs
├── IMovementHandler.cs      // Interface for player movement
│   └── MovementHandler.cs   // Uses CharacterController
├── IRotationHandler.cs      // Interface for character rotation
│   └── RotationHandler.cs
└── IAnimationHandler.cs     // Interface for animation control
    └── AnimationHandler.cs
```

Each class handles a single task, and the `MovementController` composes them together.

## Why It Follows Clean C#

### ✅ Clear Naming & Structure
- Class and method names are descriptive (e.g., `ApplyGravity`, `UpdateAnimations`).
- One public class per file.
- Fields use proper naming conventions.

### ✅ No Magic Numbers
- Constants like `Gravity = -9.81f` are defined in the gravity handler.

### ✅ DRY Principle (Don’t Repeat Yourself)
- Reusable logic like animator bool switching is encapsulated.

### ✅ Small, Focused Classes
- Each file does one thing and does it well, making the code easy to understand.

---

## How It Follows SOLID

### ✅ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Each class has a single responsibility:
- `InputHandler` handles only input.
- `GravityHandler` applies gravity.
- `MovementHandler` moves the character.
- `RotationHandler` handles rotation.
- `AnimationHandler` controls animation states.

### ✅ Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- You can add new features like dashing or jumping by creating new handlers without modifying existing ones.

### ✅ Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- All handler classes can be replaced with different implementations of the same interface without breaking functionality.

### ✅ Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Each interface (`IInputHandler`, `IAnimationHandler`, etc.) is focused and lightweight.

### ✅ Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- `MovementController` depends on abstractions (interfaces), not concrete implementations.

## How to Modify, Replace, Test, and Extend

### 🔁 Modify
Want to change how gravity works?
- Create a new class `CustomGravityHandler` implementing `IGravityHandler`.
- Replace the existing gravity handler in `MovementController` with the new one.

```csharp
IGravityHandler gravityHandler = new CustomGravityHandler();
```

### 🔄 Replace
Want to switch to a different input system or use AI?
- Create `AIInputHandler : IInputHandler`
- Replace `InputHandler` with `AIInputHandler`

### 🧪 Test
Each component is testable independently:
- Unit test `AnimationHandler` by mocking `Animator`.
- Test `RotationHandler` with dummy `Transform`.

### ➕ Extend
Want to add a jump system?
1. Create `IJumpHandler`
2. Create `JumpHandler` class implementing it
3. Inject and call it from `MovementController`

```csharp
IJumpHandler jumpHandler = new JumpHandler();
jumpHandler.HandleJump();
```

## Conclusion
This architecture ensures high cohesion and low coupling. It's easy to maintain, scale, and adapt. You can change or add systems without breaking others, making it ideal for growing projects.
